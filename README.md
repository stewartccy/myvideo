A simple online education video project based on SpringCloud.

For learning reference only, CAN NOT be used for commercial purposes.

### Build and RUN
You should install MySql Sever, IDEA on your own computer at first of course.

And then you should run the SQL file located in doc/db to init.

Modify application.properties.

blablablablah.

I'm so fvking lazy. Okay just do whatever you want on this project..


### Welcome to build this project together.
I'm still learning how to use SpringCloud. Therefore, any advice or question would be appreciated.

I'll try best to finish this project during my spare time(At least 2 commits per week LOL).
